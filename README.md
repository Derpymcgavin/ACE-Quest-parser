# Quest parser
This may have limited uses, but i made it to help me learn. 
and i had a quest file with around 77 quests in it, and wanted it in seperate files.

Once compiled, place combined quests.sql ( IT HAS TO BE NAMED quests.sql ) file in the same directory, and it will auto parse it into seperate quest named sql files in the new sub directory " Quests "
